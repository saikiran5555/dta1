    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It operates by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on features that lead to the most effective separation of classes (for classification) or the best prediction of a target variable (for regression). Each subset represents a node in the tree, and the tree structure is built by repeatedly splitting the data until a stopping condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of how the decision tree classifier algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Selecting the Best Feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts at the root node, considering all features in the dataset.\n",
    "It selects the feature that provides the best split, based on a certain criterion. Common criteria include Gini impurity for classification or mean squared error for regression.\n",
    "Splitting the Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "The selected feature is used to split the dataset into subsets. Each subset corresponds to a branch stemming from the root node.\n",
    "For categorical features, the split involves creating a branch for each category. For numerical features, the split is based on a threshold.\n",
    "Recursive Process:\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is repeated recursively for each subset, considering only the subset of data at each node.\n",
    "The algorithm continues to select features and split the data until a predefined stopping criterion is met. This could be a maximum depth of the tree, a minimum number of samples at a node, or other conditions.\n",
    "Leaf Nodes and Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "When the stopping criteria are met, the remaining nodes become leaf nodes.\n",
    "Each leaf node represents a class label (in classification) or a predicted value (in regression).\n",
    "Making Predictions:\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a prediction for a new data point, it traverses the decision tree from the root node to a leaf node based on the values of its features.\n",
    "The predicted class label or regression value associated with the reached leaf node is assigned to the new data point."
